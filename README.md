"BEAT THE ODDS" is a simple yet engaging Chrome extension that lets you roll a virtual color dice by pressing keys on your keyboard. Each number corresponds to a different color, allowing you to change the background color dynamically. After every roll, you must press 0 to reset before rolling again.
